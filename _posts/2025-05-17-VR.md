#### Introduction
Interactive technologies are becoming more common in science classes because they can turn hard to see ideas into hands-on experiences. Traditional lectures often make it hard to understand things that change or move like how molecules work or how planets travel. Interactive Learning Environments (ILEs) use digital tools to let students explore and play with science concepts. But with so many options—like augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), mixed reality (MIX), and learning games available, educators and researchers need a clear, evidence‐based roadmap for selecting the most effective format for specific learning goals.

#### What Is This Study About?
This network meta-analysis analyses findings from 53 studies. where, it systematically compares each ILE format against conventional teaching and against one another. The study analises effect of diffrent forms of ILEs on two learning outcomes:

- Cognitive outcomes (e.g., remebering, applying knowledge)

- Affective outcomes (e.g., interest, motivation)

The study also ranks the affectiveness ILEs for seperatly for the two leaning outcomes to undersant which ILEs are better suited to achive the desired leaning outcomes. The study used 53 studies that were publised between 2012 to 2023 in intrenational peer reviewd journals. Which used semi or full experimental studies done with control and experimental groups. Which were conducted at vrious learning settings (from university to primairy school settings). The study specifically looked at four diffrent ILEs:
 - **Agumented reality (AR):**a technology that places digital objects or information on top of what you see in the real world, blending virtual elements with your actual surroundings.
 - **Virdual reality (VR):** a computer-generated world that you can enter, explore, and interact with
 - **Mixed reality (MIX):** a blend of the real world and virtual elements, where you can see and interact with physical objects and digital content together in real time.
 - **Intreactive Games (Game):** video-based learning tools sometimes called digital, online, virtual, or serious games designed for education. Unlike pure AR, VR, or MIX platforms, these games use gamification (points, challenges, storylines) and may incorporate AR/VR/MR features to make learning active, engaging, and fun.

#### Key Findings
- AR ranked as the most effective format for both cognitive and affective outcomes. 

- MIX demonstrated the largest effect size compared to conventional teaching (CON) for both cognitive and affective outcomes.

- AR exhibited a larger effect size than VR for affective outcomes but did not differ significantly from VR or GAME for cognitive outcomes

- GAME outperformed CON for cognitive outcomes but did not differ significantly from VR or GAME for either outcome.

- VR’s effect size on cognitive outcomes was not significantly different from CON but was significantly higher for affective outcomes.

- Indirect comparisons revealed no significant differences between MIX and the other ILE formats for either outcome.

#### How Does This Study Rate?
##### How large or important is the observed effect?
Accoridng to  Hedges’ g interpritation the Mixed reality has a large effect size (g = 0.966) compared to conventional teaching methods. This means that learners who used Mixed railty ILEs, on avarage recived better cognitive and affectvie learning outcomes when copared with learner who studied in tradional learing envirnmrnt.

Similarly the impact of Augmented reality on both cognitive (d= 0.882) and affective (d = 1.104) found be really high. Such large effect sizes mean that AR can dramatically improve both students’ understanding of science concepts and their motivation to learn, making it a high-impact tool for the classroom.   

However,  VR exhibited no significant difference (p > 0.05) in effect size on cognitive outcomes compared to conventional methods but demonstrated a significant difference (d = 0.584, p < 0.05) in favor of VR on affective outcomes.

#####  How specific is it?
The study is notably specific in its focus on cognitive and affective outcomes, with clear comparisons made between various interactive learning environments (ILEs). By separating these outcomes, the research provides a detailed examination of how different ILEs, such as augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), mixed reality (MIX), and interactive digital games (GAME), impact learning. 

However, while the study presents the results of various statistical tests effectively, it does not delve deeply into the methodologies behind these tests. For instance, the initial single-variable meta-analysis is mentioned but not thoroughly explained, which may leave some readers seeking more clarity on the statistical approaches used. Despite this, the presentation of the results is clear, allowing for a good understanding of the findings without requiring extensive statistical knowledge.

##### How Generalizable Are the Findings?
When considering the generalizability of the findings, the study's focus on specific subjects does pose some limitations. However, it compensates for this by including a wide range of learning stages, from primary school to university level. This diversity enhances the applicability of the results across different educational contexts. The study also reports high heterogeneity for both cognitive and affective outcomes, except for the VR versus CON comparison on affective outcomes. This high heterogeneity suggests that the variance in results is more likely due to the characteristics of the studies included rather than sampling error. Meaing that studies included in the anayisis vary in how they are conducted. Consequently, while the findings can be generalized to science-specific subjects at various educational levels, caution is warranted when applying these results to other contexts or disciplines, as different educational settings may yield different outcomes. 
##### What Makes Meta-Analysis Relevant?
The relevance of this meta-analysis is underscored by the increasing integration of technology in educational environments. As various forms of ILEs become more prevalent, understanding which formats work best in specific contexts is crucial for educators and researchers. This study addresses that need by systematically evaluating the effectiveness of different ILEs in enhancing learning outcomes. By providing a comprehensive comparison of multiple ILE formats, the research offers valuable insights that can guide educational practices and inform future research in the field.
##### How Methodologically Reliable Are the Findings?
In terms of methodological reliability, the study employs robust risk-of-bias assessments, including funnel plots and Egger’s tests, which indicate low publication bias. This is a significant factor in establishing the credibility of the findings. The observed moderate heterogeneity (I²) and the consistency confirmed through subgroup analyses further support the methodological robustness of the conclusions drawn from the meta-analysis. These strengths enhance the reliability of the findings, suggesting that the results are not only statistically significant but also robust across different study characteristics and contexts.


#### Conclusion for Teaching Practice
**Emphasizing Effective ILE Formats**
Teachers should consider integrating augmented reality (AR) into their teaching strategies, as the meta-analysis indicates that AR demonstrated the largest effect size for both cognitive and affective outcomes compared to other ILE formats. This suggests that AR can significantly enhance students' engagement and understanding in science education. 

Additionally, while mixed reality (MIX) showed promise, the study highlights the need for more direct comparisons to fully understand its effectiveness.

**Tailoring Instructional Strategies**
The findings emphasize the importance of aligning instructional strategies with specific learning objectives and student needs. The effective implementation of ILEs requires thoughtful integration of these technologies into the curriculum. Teachers should not only adopt ILEs but also adapt their teaching methods to maximize the potential of these tools. This could involve designing lessons that leverage the strengths of each ILE format, ensuring that they cater to diverse learning styles and preferences. 

**Addressing Limitations and Gaps**
Teachers should be aware of the limitations identified in the study, such as the lack of direct comparisons between certain ILE formats, particularly between MIX and other ILEs. This awareness can guide educators in their choice of tools and encourage them to seek out additional resources or training that may help bridge these gaps. By staying informed about ongoing research, teachers can make more informed decisions about which technologies to implement in their classrooms.

**Fostering Student-Centric Learning**
Finally, the study highlights the importance of considering students' specific needs and learning goals when designing interventions with ILEs. Teachers should strive to create a student-centric learning environment that encourages exploration and interaction with the content. By doing so, they can foster a more engaging and effective learning experience that aligns with the findings of the meta-analysis.
